\section{Instructions}
\subsection{Overview}
As of July 12th, 2023 the file master.do contains the code to create the two final datasets, cz\_pooled.dta and cz\_stacked.dta. To be precise, it sets up and runs the subfiles in the correct order to create those datasets. To run it, you need to add the absolute paths on your computer to the if-else block at the top of the file as I have for my (Everett Stamm's) computer. You will need a path to the dropbox folder where the data is stored, a path to the repository where the code is stored, a path to your FFMPEG installation (only necessary for map creation, not data cleaning), a path to your Rterm.exe installation, and a flag for if you will use the gz7 function. 

\subsection{gz7 setup}
As of 05.17.2022, the gzuse package no longer works on Windows computers. To get around this, I created the wrapper function gz7 that calls 7zip to unzip the file. To set this up, please install 7zip and add it to your system path. https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

\subsection{R setup}
You will need the following R packages. Please install them before running the code:
\begin{itemize}
\item tidyverse
\item sf
\item haven
\item tigris
\item stringr
\item readxl
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Derenoncourt setup}
The entirety of the Derenoncourt "Can You Move to Opportunity? Evidence from the Great Migration." replication package is in the dropbox in "/municipality\_proliferation/derenoncourt\_opportunity/replication\_AER\". Within this, the folder "code" is her original replication code and the folder "code\_replication" replicates it to our specifications. To make things easier, I've copied the files with major changes into the repository. All of the do-files starting with A are new and used to create new data for the decades stacked sample. 4\_final\_dataset.do and 4\_final\_dataset\_split.do are modified versions of Derenoncourt's similarly named file that only includes variables we need and modifies it in some other ways for our analysis (e.g. raw instruments instead of rank).
