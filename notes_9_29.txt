By 1950, certain states had adopted a model law that bans discrimination by race in public
schools. I exploit these policy changes that desegregated access to a crucial local public good.
Lot size controls for a neighborhood could circumvent de jure limits on school segregation,
raising the neighborhood’s amenity value for a type of household. Consistent with the theory, I
find the highest causal effects of Black demographic change on lot size outcomes in states that
adopted these laws early.

seems like they have a harmonization proceedure for 1950 and 1960

instrument only looks at central city in a cbsa, while outcome looks at all other cities in the CBSA (i.e. the suburbs of the central city)

they seem to aggregate blackmig3539_share to the sending state level, and turn it into a control for share from each state: "state exposure shares as described in Borusyak, Hull and Jaravel (2022). 

Balance tables
Native white share, black share, central city manufacturing share, distance from CBD, homeownership rate

I reweigh jurisdictions by the units of pre-1950 housing development in their borders, as a share of total extant pre-1950 development in CBSA borders (SAME MOVIVATION AS SHARE DEVELOPED AREA)

adds a CBSA-decade level control of suburban population growth, reflecting the relative attractiveness of a city’s suburban amenities to central city ones

quadratic OLS X variable to account for nonlinearity of effects (First pct of black migrants matters more than next pct)

drop random shares of data (alternative to Leave one out test?) Broderick, Giordano and Meager (2021) (hey I suggested this)
An Automatic Finite-Sample Robustness Metric: When Can Dropping a Little Data Make a Big Difference?


long differences...95 obs???

make table for 10 cbus cle sending with blackmig3539_share, GM, and GM_hat

add "placebo" to southern white inst, or just make a main table of it

use long differences to argue why today's school gini's are related today
