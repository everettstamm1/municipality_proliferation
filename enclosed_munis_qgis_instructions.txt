2. Reproject USA_Federal_Lands and USA_Detailed_Water_Bodies as EPSG:4269
3. For USA_Federal_Lands and USA_Detailed_Water_Bodies run Vector Geometry -> Fix Geometries with Repair method == Linework
4. Vector Intersect main munis with other munis, water, and land (keep only GEOID, NAME, NAMELSA, and CZ from main_munis)
5. Merge the three intersections
6. Dissolve the merge on GEOID, NAME, NAMELSA, and CZ
7. Use editing mode to calculate length for the original muni borders and (6).
8. Merge original muni borders and (6)
