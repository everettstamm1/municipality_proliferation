can you fix the order in for main and appendix tables and add table notes to all tables and figures pleaes?

- read the main table footer and see if it's still right? And/or make it shorter yeah?

- appendix exhibits order --> (1) long difference, (2) balance table, (3) pre-trends table, (4) outcomes with balance, (5) quadratic and/or percentile table, (6) 50-70 table, (7) all the robustness figs, (8) european migration/white migration tables, (9) any appendix tables about the landuse stuff

- main exhibits --> (1) two motivation figures David will finalize, (2) main table, (3) pcarrow, (4) land use, etc. table for a total of five exhibits
