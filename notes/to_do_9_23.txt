to do
exposure robust inference for balance tables (6.2.3 of Borusyak, application of 5.2)
clean up balance tables
pre trends test
what is the "shock" being tested in t3 (make this format the main table)
pre trend should be decadal difference, or 1910-40
three decimals
choose set of balance controls more better

1950-70 and dcourt instrument first
drop (1) and (2) from balance table
create balance table, recreate main table with those that fail
hist_fin: how important state is: state spending p.c., ratio of local to state spending

*** Shocks are exogeneous so shares can be exogeneous***

add 10% to LOO tests in red, footer about how we pass at 10% level

NOTES
all pretrends look good
frac_total instead of frac_land -> 

Balance
drop:
ln_pop_dens1940, breaks everything
pop1940, what's the big deal? We're already expressing outcome PC terms 
popc1940, what's the big deal? We're already expressing X+inst in PC terms and weighting by this

change:
frac_land -> frac_total, fraction of land incorporated vs fraction of area (land+water) incorporated. p value 0.0504 on the balance test so we don't need to check robustness
totfrac_in_main_city -> urbfrac_in_main_city, similar enough and urbfrac is balanced. Could even argue it's a preferable interpretation as we're researching an urban phenomenon
m_rr_sqm_land -> m_rr_sqm_total, will take awhile to run but hoping for something similar to the frac_land -> frac_total change

keep
mfg_lfshare1940, cgoodman munis isn't robust to it (though everything else is) but we probably need to include bc it's one of ellora's main controls.
urban_share1940, looks good! special districts aren't robust but cgoodman actually gets stronger.
transpo_cost_1920, coastal, n_wells, m_rr, avg_precip, avg_temp, all balanced

Cutoff note: switching to a 0.10 cutoff from a 0.05 cutoff means we need to check robustness to transpo_cost_1920, n_wells, and frac_total. We are robust to transpo_cost_1920 and n_wells, but munis and special districts fail for frac_total. Not sure if that's a better or worse look.
