Step 1: Prep tl_2010_us_state00.shp
1. Dissolve

Step 2: Prep GL240425_lam.shp
1. Reproject to 4269
2. Fix geometry

Step 3: Prep ne_10m_ocean.shp
1. Reproject to 4269
2. Fix Geometry

Step 4: Prep main_munis.shp
1. Line to Poly
2. Fix geometry
3. Dissolve on STATEFP PLACEFP GEOID cz


Step 4: Combine
1. Take Difference between State and Ocean
2. Take Difference between that and great lakes
3. Take Intersection between that and main munis
4. Apply multipart to singleparts
5. Add virtual layer with query:

SELECT
    *
FROM
    "mm_int_sp"
GROUP BY
    "cz"
HAVING
    MAX(area(geometry))

6. Manually add back NYC, Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose:

SELECT
    *
FROM
    "mm_int_sp"
WHERE 
	"cz" == '19400' OR "cz" == '38000' OR "cz" == '38300' OR "cz" == '37500'
UNION ALL
SELECT * FROM "mm_int_sp_v"

6. Dissolve on cz GEOID STATEFP PLACEFP
7. Polygon to lines

Step 5: Create Coastal Borders
1. Polygons to lines the object from 4.2
2. Intersect that with 4.7

Step 6: Create Federal Lands borders
1. Reproject USA_Federal_Lands.shp to 4269
2. Fix Geometries (linework)
3. Polygons to lines
4. Intersect with 4.7

Step 7: 1940 Munis
1. Virtual layer with

SELECT
    *
FROM
    "all_other_munis"
WHERE 
    "yr_ncrp" <= 1940

2. Intersect with 4.7


Step 8: 1970 Munis
1. Virtual layer with

SELECT
    *
FROM
    "all_other_munis"
WHERE 
    "yr_ncrp" <= 1970

2. Intersect with 4.7

Step 9: 1940 Enclosedness
1. Union 5.2 with 6.4
2. Union that with 7.2

Step 10: 1970 Enclosedness
1. Union 9.2 with 8.2
